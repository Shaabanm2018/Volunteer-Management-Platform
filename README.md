This repository hosts the codebase for a Volunteer Management Platform, designed to streamline the process of recruiting, managing, and engaging volunteers for events organized by non-profit organizations. The platform also incorporates a donor engagement system to support the financial aspects of events.

# Motivation
In the world of non-profit organizations, the success of events heavily relies on the dedication of volunteers.
